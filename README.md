🩺 Diabetes Prediction System - Machine Learning Model 💻
=========================================================

**Overview**
------------

Welcome to the **Diabetes Prediction System**, an innovative, data-driven solution that predicts the likelihood of diabetes using machine learning. 🚀 This project integrates powerful **data preprocessing**, effective **model training**, and seamless **API deployment** to deliver real-time, actionable predictions. Whether you're a data scientist 👨‍💻 or a health tech innovator 🏥, this project demonstrates the potential of predictive analytics in healthcare.

* * *

**Project Highlights** 🌟
-------------------------

*   **Accurate Diabetes Prediction**: Utilizes machine learning to predict diabetes risk based on key health indicators such as glucose, BMI, and insulin levels. 📊
*   **Real-Time API**: A **Flask API** serves the trained model, allowing for real-time predictions through HTTP requests. 🚀
*   **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, normalizes data, and removes outliers to ensure accurate and reliable predictions. 🧹
*   **Model Serialization**: The trained model is saved using `joblib`, making deployment and future use simple and efficient. 📦

* * *

**Technologies Used** ⚙️
------------------------

*   **Python** 🐍: The primary programming language used for data manipulation, model training, and API development.
*   **Pandas** 🧑‍💻: For powerful data manipulation and analysis.
*   **Seaborn & Matplotlib** 📉: For insightful data visualizations.
*   **Scikit-learn** 🤖: For machine learning model development, evaluation, and preprocessing.
*   **Flask** 🌐: For building and deploying the web API.
*   **Joblib** 📚: For serializing and saving the trained machine learning model.

* * *

**Dataset** 🧬
--------------

The dataset used for training contains health metrics and diabetes outcomes for a set of patients. The key features are:

*   **Pregnancies**: Number of pregnancies 🍼
*   **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration 🍩
*   **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure 💓
*   **SkinThickness**: Thickness of the skin fold 📏
*   **Insulin**: Insulin levels in the blood 💉
*   **BMI**: Body Mass Index ⚖️
*   **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: A function indicating family history of diabetes 👪
*   **Age**: Age of the individual 🎂
*   **Outcome**: Whether the person has diabetes (1 = Yes, 0 = No) 🩸

* * *

**How It Works** 🔍
-------------------

1.  **Data Preprocessing** 🧹:
    
    *   Handling missing values, outliers, and scaling the data ensures the model performs optimally.
2.  **Model Training** 🏋️‍♂️:
    
    *   A **Linear Regression** model is trained on the preprocessed data to predict whether an individual is likely to have diabetes.
    *   The model is evaluated for accuracy using a test dataset to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.
3.  **API Creation** 🌐:
    
    *   A **Flask web API** is created, accepting health metrics via a POST request and returning a prediction (1 for diabetes, 0 for no diabetes).
4.  **Prediction** 🔮:
    
    *   Once deployed, the model accepts user input and predicts whether an individual has diabetes or not.

**How to Run** 🚀
-----------------

### Step 1: Clone the repository

bash

CopyEdit

`git clone https://github.com/ahmad-nadeem-official/supervised-learning-series.git
cd diabetes-prediction` 

### Step 2: Install dependencies

Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed, then install the required packages:

bash

CopyEdit

`pip install -r requirements.txt` 

### Step 3: Train the Model

Run the **main.py** script to preprocess the data, train the machine learning model, and save it:

bash

CopyEdit

`python main.py` 

This will save the trained model as `trained_model.pkl`.

### Step 4: Run the Flask API

Once the model is trained, start the Flask API by running:

bash

CopyEdit

`python api.py` 

The API will be live at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### Step 5: Test the API

To get a diabetes prediction, send a POST request to the `/predict` endpoint with the following JSON data:

json

CopyEdit

`{
    "Pregnancies": 6,
    "Glucose": 148,
    "BloodPressure": 72,
    "SkinThickness": 35,
    "Insulin": 0,
    "BMI": 33.6,
    "DiabetesPedigreeFunction": 0.627,
    "Age": 50
}` 

You will receive a JSON response like:

json

CopyEdit

`{
    "prediction": 1
}`
